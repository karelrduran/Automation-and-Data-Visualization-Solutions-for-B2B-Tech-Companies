## Overview

The system is designed to generate JSON files containing data on various companies and the results of their marketing campaigns. 
These data are derived from text files that include economic reports on the target company and its competitors. 
For this purpose, the system utilizes the OpenAI ChatGPT API.

Additionally, the system offers the capability to graphically display key campaign metrics over the years, such as:

* Investment
* Return on Investment (ROI)
* Success Rate
* Sales Increase
* Social Media Reach

These visualizations, along with additional recommendations, are generated from the previously created JSON files.

It is important to note that the company reports used in the system are fictitious and have been generated by ChatGPT, thereby ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the real companies' data.
